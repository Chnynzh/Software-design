# Software-design
Python knowledge quiz software
Project Description
This project was developed as a hobby at the beginning of learning Python, using tkinter as a graphical interface design for simple Python knowledge quiz software.

Project division of labor
George is responsible for the development of welcome interface and user system
Jerry is responsible for the development of the main interface, the answer interface and the quiz system
Co-responsible for connection and simple testing Note: The quiz questions come from the web.
Pre-run configuration
Additional Python packages need to be installed.

numpy 1.19.5
matplotlib 3.4.3
Running process
After locating pyProgramming_final_project at the root of this project, type python . /src/main.py to run it.

Note: At the time of writing this project, we have not yet studied database and soft engineering courses, so the software architecture is not quite standardized.
